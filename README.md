# Movie Trailers

This is a simple python project that takes a list of movies and builds a webpage showcasing the movie's title, poster, and youtube video.

It interacts with [TMBD's](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en) API in order to obtain movie data, and uses udacity's fresh_tomatoes.py to build the webpage

# Usage

Run entertainment_center.py in order to create the webpage, which will be saved as fresh_tomatoes.html
